# Gravitation

> A Glyphs Plugin.


## Introduction

Gravitation helps type designers (especially those designing CJK typefaces) to visualize the "visual center" of a glyph. This provides a quantifiable and intuitive method to help balance the weights within glyphs.


## Installation

1. Make sure Glyphs's Python is up-to-date (this can be done be removing and reinstalling Python in Plugin Manager > Modules).

2. If you have brew, run
```shell
brew install vips
```

3. Install numpy and pyvips using
```shell
~/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs\ 3/Repositories/GlyphsPythonPlugin/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/pip3 install -t ~/Library/Application\ Support/Glyphs\ 3/Scripts/site-packages numpy pyvips
```
